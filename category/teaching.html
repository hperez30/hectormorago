            <h3>Speeding up Derivative Configuration from Product Platforms</h3>

        <strong>Abstract</strong> : To compete in the global marketplace, manufacturers try to differentiate their products by focusing on individual customer needs. Fulfilling this goal requires that companies shift from mass production to mass customization. Under this approach, a generic architecture, named product platform, is designed to support the derivation of customized products through a configuration process that determines which components the product comprises. When a customer configures a derivative, typically not every combination of available components is valid. To guarantee that all dependencies and incompatibilities among the derivative constituent components are satisfied, automated configurators are used. Flexible product platforms provide a big number of interrelated components, and so, the configuration of all, but trivial, derivatives involves considerable effort to select which components the derivative should include. Our approach alleviates that effort by speeding up the derivative configuration using a heuristic based on the information theory concept of entropy.

<h3>Augmenting Measure Sensitivity to Detect Essential, Dispensable and Highly Incompatible Features in Mass Customization</h3>

        <strong>Abstract</strong> : Mass customization is the new frontier in business competition for both manufacturing and service industries. To improve customer satisfaction, reduce lead-times and shorten costs, families of similar products are built jointly by combining reusable parts that implement the features demanded by the customers. To guarantee the validity of the products derived from mass customization processes, feature dependencies and incompatibilities are usually specified with a variability model. As market demand grows and evolves, variability models become increasingly complex. In such entangled models it is hard to identify which features are essential, dispensable, highly required by other features, or highly incompatible with the remaining features. This paper exposes the limitations of existing approaches to gather such knowledge and provides efficient algorithms to retrieve that information from variability models.

        <strong>Abstract</strong> : Software product line engineering has proven to be an efficient paradigm to developing families of similar software systems at lower costs, in shorter time, and with higher quality. This paper analyzes the literature on product lines from 1995 to 2014, identifying the most influential publications, the most researched topics, and how the interest in those topics has evolved along the way. Bibliographic data have been gathered from ISI Web of Science and Scopus. The data have been examined using two prominent bibliometric approaches: science mapping and performance analysis.Results: According to the study carried out, (i) software architecture was the initial motor of research in SPL; (ii) work on systematic software reuse has been essential for the development of the area; and (iii) feature modeling has been the most important topic for the last fifteen years, having the best evolution behavior in terms of number of published papers and received citations. Science mapping has been used to identify the main researched topics, the evolution of the interest in those topics and the relationships among topics. Performance analysis has been used to recognize the most influential papers, the journals and conferences that have published most papers, how numerous is the literature on product lines and what is its distribution over time.
