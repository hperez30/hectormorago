        &lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt; : To compete in the global marketplace, manufacturers try to differentiate their products by focusing on individual customer needs. Fulfilling this goal requires that companies shift from mass production to mass customization. Under this approach, a generic architecture, named product platform, is designed to support the derivation of customized products through a configuration process that determines which components the product comprises. When a customer configures a derivative, typically not every combination of available components is valid. To guarantee that all dependencies and incompatibilities among the derivative constituent components are satisfied, automated configurators are used. Flexible product platforms provide a big number of interrelated components, and so, the configuration of all, but trivial, derivatives involves considerable effort to select which components the derivative should include. Our approach alleviates that effort by speeding up the derivative configuration using a heuristic based on the information theory concept of entropy. View Full-Text

        &lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt; : Software product line engineering has proven to be an efficient paradigm to developing families of similar software systems at lower costs, in shorter time, and with higher quality. This paper analyzes the literature on product lines from 1995 to 2014, identifying the most influential publications, the most researched topics, and how the interest in those topics has evolved along the way. Bibliographic data have been gathered from ISI Web of Science and Scopus. The data have been examined using two prominent bibliometric approaches: science mapping and performance analysis.Results: According to the study carried out, (i) software architecture was the initial motor of research in SPL; (ii) work on systematic software reuse has been essential for the development of the area; and (iii) feature modeling has been the most important topic for the last fifteen years, having the best evolution behavior in terms of number of published papers and received citations. Science mapping has been used to identify the main researched topics, the evolution of the interest in those topics and the relationships among topics. Performance analysis has been used to recognize the most influential papers, the journals and conferences that have published most papers, how numerous is the literature on product lines and what is its distribution over time.

        &lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt; : Mass customization enables the creation of personalized products that fulfill the features desired by specific customers. In this context, variability models are used to specify which configurable features are supported and which constraints among the features must be satisfied to guarantee the validity of the derived products. As the market demand grows and evolves, variability models become increasingly complex. In such entangled models, it is hard to identify which features are absolutely essential or dispensable because they are required to be included or excluded from all the possible products, respectively. This paper exposes the limitations of existing approaches to automatically detect those features and provides an algorithm that efficiently performs such detection.

        &lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt; : Variability models play a key role in software product line engineering as they are used to represent the common and variable features that products may include, and what constraints among the features must be satisfied to guarantee the validity of the products. Valuable analysis operations on variability models can be performed by black box reusing logic engines, such as SAT-solvers and binary decision diagram libraries. Unfortunately, such kind of reuse implies long computation times for operations that need calling the engines many times. To overcome this problem, we propose new algorithms that directly deal with the data structure of a binary decision diagram encoding a variability model. In particular, our algorithms are specifically designed to detect core &amp; dead features, and the impact &amp; exclusion sets of every feature.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;
To compete in the global marketplace, manufacturers try to differentiate their products by focusing on individual customer needs. Fulfilling this goal requires companies to shift from mass production to mass customization. In the context of software development, software product line engineering has emerged as a cost-effective approach to developing families of similar products by supporting high levels of mass customization.
Variability models are often used to specify the common and variable features of the products in one such family. Moreover, they model the inter-feature constraints which must be satisfied to guarantee the validity of the derived products. Despite the benefits of variability models, constructing and maintaining them can be a laborious task, especially in product lines with a large number of features and constraints. As a consequence, the study of automated techniques to reason on variability models has become an important research topic for the product line community.&lt;/p&gt;
